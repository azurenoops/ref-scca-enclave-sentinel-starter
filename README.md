# Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel starter

Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel Environment is a highly opinionated Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Sentinel as code implementation that Cyber Security oversight teams may use to establish a cloud security management solution for their workloads and teams to deploy to Azure environments.

This starter is intended to assist customers and partners in quickly establishing a fully functional Microsoft Sentinel environment, thereby speeding up deployment and initial configuration tasks, saving time,Â and simplifying Microsoft Sentinel setup.

Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel starter automates the following tasks:

- Enables UEBA with the relevant identity providers (AAD and/or AD)
- Enables health diagnostics for Analytics Rules, Data Connectors and Automation Rules
- Installs Content Hub solutions from a predefined list in three categories: 1st party, Essentials and Training
- Enables Data Connectors from this list:
  - Azure Active Directory (with the ability to select which data types will be ingested)
  - Azure Active Directory Identity Protection
  - Azure Activity (from current subscription)
  - Dynamics 365
  - Microsoft 365 Defender
  - Microsoft Defender for Cloud
  - Microsoft Insider Risk Management
  - Microsoft Power BI
  - Microsoft Project
  - Office 365
  - Threat Intelligence Platforms

## Getting Started ##

### Prerequisites ###

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Azure Subscription**: You need an Azure subscription to create resources in Azure. If you don't have one, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

- **Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell**: You need either Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell installed and configured to interact with your Azure account. You can download them from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps) respectively.

- **Terraform**: You will need Terraform installed to deploy the infrastructure. You can download Terraform from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

- **Knowledge of Azure Sentinel**: This project involves deploying and managing Azure Sentinel resources. Familiarity with Azure Sentinel and its concepts is recommended.

Please replace the links and the software versions with the ones that are relevant to your project.

## JFHQ-DODIN TASKORD 24-006 Support

Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel starter supports the JFHQ-DODIN TASKORD 24-006 by providing the ability to deploy and manage Azure Sentinel components.

### Required Installed Components

These components are installed automatically as part of the [Azure NoOps Sentinel Overlay module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/azurenoops/overlays-sentinel/azurerm/latest):

- Azure Monitor MS Entra Id Diagnostic Settings
- Azure UBEA Solutions
- Azure Content Hub Solutions (MS XDR)
- Azure Data Connectors (MS Entra Id, MS XDR)

## Deploy Manually with Terraform ##

You can deploy Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel using the Terraform CLI. The Terraform CLI will deploy the infrastructure to the Azure subscription you have configured in the Terraform CLI.

You must have [Owner RBAC permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) to the subscription(s) you deploy Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel into.

The below scenario is how to get started on the Mission Enclave Sentinel implementation manually. This implementation has a detailed README.md that will walk you through the deployment steps.

Manual Deployment Details:
| Deployment Methodology | Manual Deployment |
|--------------|--------------|
|Terraform|[Published](./docs/10-manual-deployment-guide-terraform.md)

>NOTE: Using manual deployment to deploy the infrastructure using the Terraform CLI. This is a good option if you want to learn how to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform CLI.

## Deploy with GitHub Actions ##

You can deploy Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel using the GitHub Actions. The GitHub Actions will deploy the infrastructure to the Azure subscription you have configured in the GitHub Secrets.

You must have [Owner RBAC permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) to the subscription(s) you deploy Azure NoOps Mission Enclave Sentinel into.

The below scenario is how to get started on the Mission Enclave Sentinel implementation with GitHub Actions. This implementation has a detailed README.md that will walk you through the deployment steps.
